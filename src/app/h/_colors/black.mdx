This fetish can encompass a wide range of activities, including <HoverCard color="gray">bondage</HoverCard>, discipline, impact play, and various forms of role-playing. Participants may use specific tools and accessories such as restraints, whips, and other implements to enhance the sensory experience.

It's crucial to note that in the context of a healthy and consensual relationship, participants establish clear boundaries, communication, and trust to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all involved. As with any sexual preference or fetish, it is essential to prioritize consent, communication, and respect to create a positive and fulfilling experience for everyone involved.
