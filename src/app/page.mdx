# homosocialization for terminally online perverts

## flagging
also know as ["the hanky code"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief_code) is a longstanding tradation in the gay community meant to covertly signal your sexual availability and preferences to others while out crusing for casual sex. by wearing color-coded handkerchiefs in your back pocket, you can let others know what you're into and what you're looking for, as well as your prefered position. hankies worn on your left side indicate you are a top, and when worn on the left, it shows you're a bottom.

the practice of flagging has long since fallen out of fashion, but now you can flag online and let other perverts know what you're into.
